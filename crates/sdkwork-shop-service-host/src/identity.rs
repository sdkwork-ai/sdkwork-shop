//! Snowflake identity bootstrap for the Shop composition host.
//!
//! Shop tables use platform Snowflake `BIGINT` primary keys (`DATABASE_SPEC.md` §6.1,
//! `SUBJECT_ID_SPEC`). Those keys cannot be invented per call site: a Snowflake id encodes a node id
//! plus a per-node sequence, so two generators sharing a node id silently produce duplicate keys.
//! This module is the single place that acquires the process identity.
//!
//! Shop is not the only writer in its process: the app catalog routes build a merchandise catalog
//! store to mint merchandise ids. That store takes this same generator as a constructor argument, so
//! one process never runs two sequences over one node id.
//!
//! # Why the allocator, not a local generator
//!
//! In production-like environments the node id comes from the platform node registry through
//! [`SnowflakeNodeAllocator::allocate_process_generator`], which
//!
//! - leases a node id that is unique across every running process,
//! - returns the **same** generator to every caller in this process, so every repository composed
//!   into this host shares one node id and one sequence state, and
//! - rejects a second generator bound to a different database authority.
//!
//! A statically configured node id is therefore refused in production-like environments: it cannot
//! be collision-free once more than one instance runs. Development and test runs use a static node
//! id so local boots do not depend on the node registry table existing.
//!
//! # Why the id is injected, not global
//!
//! The repositories take `Arc<dyn IdGenerator>` as an explicit dependency. A process-global
//! generator would make two hosts in one test process share a sequence and would hide the dependency
//! that decides a row's primary key.
